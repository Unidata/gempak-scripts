This is the directory where all the model product scripts reside.

The scripts are separated into subdirectories here based on what color table they use.
Similar kinds of products will often share the same color table, but there are exceptions.

A coltbl.xwp file resides in each of these subdirectories.
Each script in that subdirectory will reference that coltbl.xwp file.
